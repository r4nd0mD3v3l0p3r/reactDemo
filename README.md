ReactDemo

a simple webapp to display React/Redux capabilities
It uses an embedded MongoDB instance, and it is populated at boot time (so please wait patiently as it starts :D )
It comes as a Visual Studio solution, so you need VS to launch it.

Frontend:
React
Redux
MaterialUI
Json Web Token to handle user authentication
Moment.js to handle dates
Helmet for head tags
react-cookie to manage cookies

Backend:
ASP.NET CORE C# Web API
MongoDB
